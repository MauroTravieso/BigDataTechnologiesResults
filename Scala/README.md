##### Scala Application: ATM system prototype
 
    Concepts: classes and objects,
              inheritance,
              method definition,
              method overriding,
              if-else conditional statement,
              match-case expresion matching,
              Collections
              ListBuffer data structure
              File I/O
              Exception handling
              
 
    Application structure:
 
              ATMsystem (Driver entry point of the application)
              Account -> Parent class
              Bank    -> Subclass, inherits from Account
              CurrentAccount -> -> Subclass, inherits from Account
              SavingsAccount -> -> Subclass, inherits from Account
